Ticket: RDK-45036
Test: Verifies that when the local storage is corrupted, items still in memory are written again to the
      database after a recovery mechanism re-creates the database (although empty)

Guidance:
The local storage database location for a given site is device dependent. On Llama, the database can be
accessed from the host for an app (running inside a container) via following path, where <pid of web process>
is the pid of the WPEWebProcess and <url> is the url to this test html file with special characters
replaced by underscores:

/proc/<pid of web process>/root/home/private/.local/share/data/Comcast/NativeXREReceiver/<url>.localstorage

For example, if the WPEWebProcess has pid 3215 and we opened the url http://10.42.0.1:8000, the path is:

/proc/3215/root/home/private/.local/share/data/Comcast/NativeXREReceiver/http_10.42.0.1_8000.localstorage

On other devices, this path needs to be adjusted accordingly.

To ensure a clean state, we need to remove the database file first before proceeding with the tests. This
can be done by launching the web process with the url to this test html file and then running the
following commands on the device:

- pstree -p | grep WPEWebProcess
- rm /proc/<pid of web process>/root/home/private/.local/share/data/Comcast/NativeXREReceiver/<url>.localstorage
- kill <pid of web process>

This will delete the database and kill the browser so no items will be written before it exits.

Now, launch the url again and follow the steps. When reaching the step to corrupt the database, use the
following command
- echo "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" | dd of=/proc/<pid of web process/root/home/private/.local/share/data/Comcast/NativeXREReceiver/<url>.localstorage lbs=1 seek=4096

Proceed with the test following the guidance on screen.

Note: Database contents can be inspected with the following command:
- hexdump -C /proc/<pid of web process>/root/home/private/.local/share/data/Comcast/NativeXREReceiver/<url>.localstorage

How to run in standalone mode:
- On the same folder where this file resides, run "python3 -m http.server 8000" to launch the http server
- On the box, open the url "http://<server ip>:8000/<name of this file>"
   - Replace "<server ip>" with the ip address of the machine where you launched the command above, and
     "<name of this file>" with the name of this html file
